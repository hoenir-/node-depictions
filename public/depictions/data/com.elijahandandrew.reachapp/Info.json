	"fulldescription": "Reachability is a new feature added in iOS 8, specifically for iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus. Most people, however, find it fairly useless. ReachApp adds the ability to put an app into the Reachability view for true split-screen multitasking. It can also do this with the Notification Center. There are several options to configure. A full feature list can be found below.",
